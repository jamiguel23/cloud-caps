## appoach

This lab was once again very hard to follow. After following along with the lecture I started to get some access to denied errors even though my IAM permissions were all up to date. Will ask for more guidance from Jacob tomorrow because I really want to understand this.

The idea behind the lab was to have a pub/sub relationship that will be hosted on the cloud using a queue system where the subscriber will be notified for queued items that have a payload that need to be sent.
